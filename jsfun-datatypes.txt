JavaScript is dynamically typed ie the variables are not bound to a 
particular data type
there are 6 primitive data types number, bigint, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol

Number data type: special numeric types Infinity -Infinity and NaN are also number type
                NaN represents computation error as result of incorrect or undefined mathematical operation
                NaN is sticky, it propagates eg: NaN*3=NaN; but except NaN**0=1;

Big Int:for number outside range +/-(2^53-1)
        syntax
        //by appending n
        const num = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
        //or
        let  num = BigInt(2**55);

The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable.

    Usually used as typeof x, but typeof(x) is also possible.
    Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
    For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.

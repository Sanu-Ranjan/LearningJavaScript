in javascript variables are case sensitive should not start with number 
$ and _ are allowed but not -
cannot be reserverd words like let, function, class, return etc....
"use strict" if used then we need to define variable before using it 
   else it will throw not defined error

Upper Case Constants: for difficult to remember values that are known befor execution,
   such constants are names using capital letters and under scores eg:-
   const COLOR_ORANGE="#FF7F00"

   capital naming should only be used for hard coded constants 
   and not for storing run time constants

Some good-to-follow rules for variable naming are:

    Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.
    Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, and c, unless you know what you’re doing.
    Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value. Such names 
    say nothing. It’s only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious 
    which data or value the variable is referencing.
    Agree on terms within your team and in your mind. If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should 
    name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.

Modern JavaScript minifiers and browsers optimize code well enough, so it won’t create performance issues.
  Using different variables for different values can even help the engine optimize your code.

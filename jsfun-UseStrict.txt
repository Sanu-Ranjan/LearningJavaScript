"use strict" or 'use strict' when located at top whole scrit works modern way
it should be put at top else it will not be activated
it can be used in functions at top

in developer console it does not use "use strict" by default
so we use chunk of code and put "use strict"; at top and use shift+Enter to write code in next lines.
in really old browsers where this does not work we can use (self Invoking function) the following code
(function(){
    "use strict";
    //code here
})()

Modern javascript supports classes and modules that enable use strict automatically so
we dont spefifically need to write them.

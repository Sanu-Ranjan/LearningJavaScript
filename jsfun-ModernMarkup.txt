1.The type attribute in "<script type=""></script> is no longer used in modern HTML, instead it is used for javascript modules.
well this can be used to identify really old code, because it is not used in modern javascript.

2.but if we have a lot of javascript or complex code it is put in separate file and then linked 
 <script src="/path/.../script.js">

If there are multiple files we use multiple tags
<script src="/js/script1.js"></script>
<script src="/js/script2.js"></script>

we can use urls as well
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/lodash.js/4.17.11/lodash.js"></script>

3.If there is src used then script insde is ignored
